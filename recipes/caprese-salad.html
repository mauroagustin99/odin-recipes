    <p>This classic Caprese Salad is a simple yet delicious dish that highlights the flavors of ripe tomatoes, creamy
        mozzarella, and fragrant basil. It's perfect as an appetizer or a light side dish for any meal.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh tomatoes (2-3 medium-sized)</li>
        <li>Fresh mozzarella cheese (1 ball or about 8 ounces)</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves (a handful)</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Balsamic vinegar (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Slice the Tomatoes:</b> Wash and slice the fresh tomatoes into rounds, about 1/4-inch thick.</li>
        <li><b>Slice the Mozzarella:</b> Similarly, slice the fresh mozzarella cheese into rounds, similar in thickness to the tomatoes.</li>
        <li><b>Arrange on a Plate:</b> Begin by arranging the tomato and mozzarella slices on a serving plate. You can alternate them for a visually appealing presentation.</li>
        <li><b>Add Fresh Basil:</b> Wash and dry the fresh basil leaves. Place a basil leaf between each tomato and mozzarella slice. You can also tear the basil leaves into smaller pieces and scatter them over the top.</li>
        <li><b>Drizzle with Olive Oil:</b> Drizzle extra-virgin olive oil over the tomato, mozzarella, and basil. Use a good quality olive oil for the best flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Balsamic Vinegar (Optional):</b> If desired, you can also add a drizzle of balsamic vinegar for extra flavor. Balsamic reduction or glaze can also be used for a sweeter touch.</li>
        <li><b>Season:</b> Sprinkle salt and freshly ground black pepper over the salad to taste. Remember that the mozzarella can be a bit salty, so adjust accordingly.</li>
        <li><b>Serve:</b> Your Caprese Salad is ready to be served. It's best enjoyed fresh and at room temperature.</li>
