    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Cook the Macaroni:</b> In a large pot, bring water to a boil and cook the macaroni pasta according to the package instructions until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><b>Brown the Ground Meat:</b> In a separate large pot or Dutch oven, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic and saut√© until they become translucent and fragrant.</li>
        <li><b>Add the Ground Meat:</b> Add the ground meat (e.g., beef) to the pot. Break it up with a spatula and cook until it's browned and no longer pink, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li><b>Season the Meat:</b> Season the meat with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning (or your preferred dried herbs). Mix well to incorporate the flavors.</li>
        <li><b>Add Vegetables:</b> Stir in the diced carrots, peas, and bell peppers (if using). Cook for a few minutes until the vegetables start to soften.</li>
        <li><b>Pour in Tomato Sauce:</b> Add the tomato sauce or diced tomatoes to the pot. You can also add a bit of chicken or beef broth to achieve your desired consistency. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li><b>Simmer:</b> Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the stew simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the flavors meld together. Stir occasionally.</li>
        <li><b>Combine with Cooked Macaroni:</b> Once the stew has simmered to your satisfaction, add the cooked macaroni pasta to the pot. Stir everything together, allowing the pasta to absorb some of the sauce.</li>
        <li><b>Taste and Adjust:</b> Taste the stew and adjust the seasoning with more salt, pepper, or herbs as needed.</li>
        <li><b>Serve:</b> Ladle the macaroni stew into bowls. If desired, garnish with grated Parmesan cheese. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
